=== GED C++ coding challenge ===

This code is a working server/client application implemented in C++. After the server is started
it waits for the client to connect. The client then waits for a message from the server and
followed by a message back to the server.

Currently, the client and server are coded in a very procedural style. We rather would like to see
object oriented code. Hence, the tasks of this challenge are as follows:

 a. Try to compile the code (Client.cpp and Server.cpp) - either with the Makefile provided or
    however is most convenient for you. Then try and run the server/client application and
    record the output.
 
 b. Implement a class wrapper (Socket.h/Socket.cpp) for the TCP socket and use it instead of
    the procedural code in Server.cpp and Client.cpp to obtain exactly the same
    behaviour and output as the original application
    
 c. (Bonus) Implement a C++ wrapper for both a TCP and UDP socket so it satisfies the factory pattern
    class relationship as shown in the UML sketch below. Then implement the static Create() method
    of the Socket class (e.g. "Socket *Socket::Create(bool isTcp)") to return either an instance of
    a TcpSocket or UdpSocket depending on the value of the input parameter.
    Finally, add this new functionality to the server/client example to be able to send messages between
    the client and server either over TCP or UDP (one-line change in Client.cpp and Server.cpp from task b).
